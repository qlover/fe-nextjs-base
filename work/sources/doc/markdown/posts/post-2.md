Every VPN is different, which means some are better for streaming than others. You might find that a provider has a monthly data cap, for instance, which means you won’t be able to watch as much as you’d like. Alternatively, they might not provide the Italian servers or high speeds needed for streaming Rai TV. In short, there’s a lot to consider when deciding which VPN to use.

The good news is that Hotspot Shield is an excellent choice for Rai TV. We have servers in two Italian cities (Rome and Milan), and they work with DPlay, Mediaset, Netflix, and more. Not only that, but our premium subscribers are free to steam as much as they like, with no speed or bandwidth limits.
